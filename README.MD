# CLI tools based on Node.js and Openai API

## short introducing

This is a CLI utility that fetches the Openai API (3.2.1 version) and uses a new gpt-3.5-turbo model that is optimized for chat at 1/10th the cost of the previous one

The tool can be launched in the command line from any location by typing **ai**

Type `.help` to see all available commands:

- cefr -cefr show CEFR levels
- chinese -ch -c translate into Chinese
- clear .clear .c clear the input history
- english -e -Ð¿ translate into English
- exit .exit .q /q :q .Ð¹ close the programm
- grammar -g check the grammar
- help .help -help .h -h print help info
- literary -l make a sentence more literary
- pinyin -p show the Pinyin transcription
- translate -t -ru translate into Russian

You can easily add your own commands. Just open `const.js` file and update the COMMAND object.

For instance:

```js
export const COMMAND = {
  /*
  old commands
  */
  CEFR: {
    key: ['-cefr'], //your short command
    description: 'show CEFR levels', //help info
    instruction: 'correlate the following words with CEFR levels of difficulty', //verbal request to AI
  },
};
```

## how does it look in cli?

Added the counter that shows the **number of tokens** spent and the corresponding **time of request**

Error handling:

This is an old screenshot because it was hard to catch the error and handle it. OpenAI has been working fine lately ðŸ«¡

## known issues

- If you encounter difficulties, change the first row in the **index.js** file and specify your Node.js path directory. Use command `which node` in your cli to find out the Node.js path (on mac/linux)
